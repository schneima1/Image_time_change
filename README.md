This script adjusts the EXIF timestamp of images in a specified folder. e.g. if the time of your camera is set incorrectly, you can adjust the timestamps of all images taken by that camera by selecting the correct time difference.
It is useful to first test it with only a single image by changing the `folder_path` variable to point to a single image file, e.g. images_test.
